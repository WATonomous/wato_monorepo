# Behavior Tree Naming & Structure Standards

To ensure consistency and maintainability across Eve's behavior engine, all new Behavior Tree (BT) nodes must follow these standards.

# Nodes Folder structure

- if ever you think a node could be use else where you can rename it and register it under the common subdirectory
- this folder structure is soley for readibility. hopefully we can get this feature in soon that way our node registrar can be even cleaner
