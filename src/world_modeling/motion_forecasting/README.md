# Motion Forecasting

Contains modules and algorithms for predicting the future motion of various entities, such as cars, cyclists, and pedestrians.

## PGP (Probabilistic Graphical Prediction)

PGP is a trajectory prediction module that predicts the future motion of cars.

Please note that PGP is currently designed specifically for vehicles and may not provide accurate predictions for other entities, such as cyclists and pedestrians.

### TODO

- Implement trajectory prediction for cyclists.
- Implement trajectory prediction for pedestrians.
