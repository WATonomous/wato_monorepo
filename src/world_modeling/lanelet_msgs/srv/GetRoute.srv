# GetRoute.srv
# Get route with per-lanelet data between two lanelets.

# Returns the shortest path as a sequence of Lanelet messages,
# each containing geometry, semantics, and connectivity.

uint8 TRANSITION_SUCCESSOR=0  # Following (collinear, no lane change)
uint8 TRANSITION_LEFT=1       # Lane change to the left
uint8 TRANSITION_RIGHT=2      # Lane change to the right

bool success

# Error description if success is false
# Values: "lanelet_not_found", "no_route_exists", "map_not_loaded"

# Total route length (meters)

# Lanelets along the shortest path (in traversal order)

# Transition type between each pair of successive lanelets.
# Length is lanelets.size() - 1 (empty if path has 0 or 1 lanelets).
# transitions[i] describes how to get from lanelets[i] to lanelets[i+1].
